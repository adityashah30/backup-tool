# Backup Tool

This is an ideal tool to backup entire drives on the computer using last modified date

The file dir_info.txt has the following structure:
1. The first line contains a semi-colon (;) separated list of "from" paths on your computer.
2. The second line contains a semi-colon (;) separated list of "to" paths (may be remote, may be local) corresponding to the "from" list order.
3. The third line contains a semi-colon (;) separated list of exempted locations. These paths are those which would be skipped from copying and would normally reside within the "from" path list.
